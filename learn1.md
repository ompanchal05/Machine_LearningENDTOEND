## 🧠 What is Machine Learning?

| Topic | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| Machine Learning | Teaching computers to learn from data |
| Input | Past data |
| Output | Predictions / decisions |
| Without ML | Fixed rules |
| With ML | Data-driven learning |

---

## 📊 Types of Machine Learning

| Type | Meaning | Examples |
|------|--------|----------|
| Supervised Learning | Data with labels | Linear Reg, Logistic Reg, KNN |
| Unsupervised Learning | No labels | KMeans, PCA |
| Semi-Supervised Learning | Few labels | Text & image tasks |
| Reinforcement Learning | Reward-based | Games, Robotics |

## 🧩 Dataset Basics

### Features vs Target

| Term | Symbol | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| Features | X | Input variables |
| Target | y | Output variable |
| X | Capital | Matrix (many columns) |
| y | Small | Vector (single column) |

Example:
X = [Age, Salary, Experience]
y = [Price]

## ✂️ Train–Test Split

| Item | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| Purpose | Test model on unseen data |
| Training Set | Used to learn patterns |
| Testing Set | Used to evaluate model |
| Common Split | 80% Train / 20% Test |
| Benefit | Avoids overfitting |

---

## ❓ Why X is Capital and y is Small?

| Symbol | Reason |
|------|--------|
| X | Represents feature matrix |
| y | Represents output vector |
| Convention | From mathematics |

Example:
X shape → (100, 5)
y shape → (100,)

| Item | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| Meaning | Make all features same scale |
| Why | Distance & gradient sensitive |
| Without Scaling | Poor learning |
| Common Tool | StandardScaler |

### Models That Need Scaling

| Model | Scaling Needed |
|------|---------------|
| KNN | Yes |
| SVM | Yes |
