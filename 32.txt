MAANG-LEVEL UPGRADE PLAN (DATA / ML ROLES)
==========================================

PURPOSE
-------
This guide is for:
- Product-based companies
- High-paying ML roles
- Strong technical interviews
- Serious career upgrade

Rule:
-----
MAANG does not test memorization.
MAANG tests depth + clarity + trade-offs.

=================================================
SECTION 1: WHAT CHANGES AT MAANG LEVEL?
=================================================

Normal companies test:
- Basic ML
- Basic SQL
- Simple projects

MAANG tests:
- Why algorithm works
- When not to use it
- Trade-offs
- Scalability
- System thinking

=================================================
SECTION 2: ML DEPTH UPGRADE
=================================================

You must deeply understand:

1. Linear Regression
   - Assumptions
   - Why MSE
   - When it fails

2. Logistic Regression
   - Why sigmoid
   - Log loss
   - Decision boundary

3. Bias–Variance Tradeoff
   - Mathematical intuition
   - Real examples

4. Regularization
   - L1 vs L2
   - Why L1 does feature selection

5. Cross-validation
   - Why k-fold is better than single split

You must be able to explain without notes.

=================================================
SECTION 3: ENSEMBLES (VERY IMPORTANT)
=================================================

Understand deeply:

- Why Random Forest reduces variance
- Why Boosting reduces bias
- Difference between Bagging & Boosting
- When XGBoost fails

Interview question example:
----------------------------
"Why did your XGBoost overfit?"

You must answer logically.

=================================================
SECTION 4: SYSTEM DESIGN (ML)
=================================================

At MAANG level, expect:

- Design a recommendation system
- Design fraud detection system
- Design ranking algorithm

You must cover:
- Data pipeline
- Feature store
- Model training
- Deployment
- Monitoring
- Scaling
- Trade-offs

Never jump directly to model.

=================================================
SECTION 5: SQL ADVANCED
=================================================

Be strong in:

- Complex JOINs
- Window functions
- Subqueries
- Aggregation logic
- Ranking functions

You should solve medium SQL problems comfortably.

=================================================
SECTION 6: CODING DEPTH
=================================================

Expect:

- Implement algorithm from scratch
- Explain time complexity
- Optimize slow code
- Handle edge cases

Practice:
---------
- Gradient Descent from scratch
- KNN from scratch
- Train-test split manually

=================================================
SECTION 7: DEEP LEARNING UPGRADE
=================================================

If role requires DL:

Understand:
- Vanishing gradient
- Batch normalization
- Why Transformers work
- Attention mechanism intuition
- Model optimization trade-offs

Explain clearly, not mathematically heavy.

=================================================
SECTION 8: SCALABILITY THINKING
=================================================

MAANG cares about scale.

Be ready to answer:
- What if data grows 100x?
- How do you reduce latency?
- How do you retrain at scale?

Mention:
- Distributed systems
- Batch vs real-time
- Monitoring pipelines

=================================================
SECTION 9: BEHAVIORAL AT PRODUCT COMPANIES
=================================================

They test:
- Ownership
- Leadership
- Problem-solving mindset
- Handling ambiguity

Answer using:
Situation → Action → Result format

=================================================
SECTION 10: 90-DAY MAANG UPGRADE PLAN
=================================================

Month 1:
--------
- Strengthen ML theory deeply
- Practice SQL medium problems

Month 2:
--------
- System design practice
- Build 1 production-style project

Month 3:
--------
- Mock interviews
- Implement algorithms from scratch

=================================================
SECTION 11: MAANG INTERVIEW MINDSET
=================================================

- Think before speaking
- Clarify requirements
- Start simple
- Scale gradually
- Discuss trade-offs

=================================================
FINAL ELITE RULES
=================================================

1. Depth > Breadth
2. Why > What
3. Trade-offs matter
4. Scale thinking matters
5. Calm communication wins

=================================================
FINAL MESSAGE
=================================================

MAANG level is not about genius.
It is about structured thinking.

If your fundamentals are strong,
you can reach there.

Consistency + depth = elite level.
