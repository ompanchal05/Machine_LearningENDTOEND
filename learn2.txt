=================================================
SECTION 2: DATA SCIENTIST INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
=================================================

Q9. What is a Data Scientist?
A:
A Data Scientist uses statistics, programming, and machine learning to build predictive models and solve complex problems.

-------------------------------------------------

Q10. What is Machine Learning?
A:
Machine Learning is a technique where machines learn patterns from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed.

-------------------------------------------------

Q11. Types of Machine Learning?
A:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Semi-supervised Learning
4. Reinforcement Learning

-------------------------------------------------

Q12. What is Supervised Learning?
A:
Learning from labeled data (X and y).

Examples:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- KNN
- SVM

-------------------------------------------------

Q13. What is Unsupervised Learning?
A:
Learning from unlabeled data.

Examples:
- KMeans clustering
- PCA

-------------------------------------------------

Q14. What is train-test split?
A:
It splits data into:
- Training data (to learn)
- Testing data (to evaluate)

Purpose:
- Avoid overfitting
- Test on unseen data

-------------------------------------------------

Q15. Why X is capital and y is small?
A:
X represents a feature matrix (many columns).
y represents a target vector (one column).
This is a mathematical convention.

-------------------------------------------------

Q16. What is overfitting?
A:
When a model memorizes training data and performs poorly on new data.

-------------------------------------------------

Q17. What is underfitting?
A:
When a model is too simple and fails to learn patterns.

-------------------------------------------------

Q18. What is bias vs variance?
A:
- High bias → underfitting
- High variance → overfitting
Goal is to balance both.

-------------------------------------------------

Q19. What is feature scaling?
A:
Scaling brings all features to the same range.
It is important for distance-based and gradient-based models.

-------------------------------------------------

Q20. Models that require scaling?
A:
- Logistic Regression
- KNN
- SVM
- Gradient Descent

(Tree models do not need scaling)

-------------------------------------------------

Q21. What is Gradient Descent?
A:
An optimization algorithm that minimizes loss by updating weights step by step.

-------------------------------------------------

Q22. What is a loss function?
A:
A function that measures how wrong the model is.

Examples:
- MSE → regression
- Log loss → classification

=================================================
SECTION 3: MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEER INTERVIEW
=================================================

Q23. What is the role of an ML Engineer?
A:
An ML Engineer builds, optimizes, deploys, and maintains machine learning models in production.

-------------------------------------------------

Q24. Difference between Data Scientist and ML Engineer?
A:
Data Scientist focuses on modeling and analysis.
ML Engineer focuses on deployment, pipelines, and scalability.

-------------------------------------------------

Q25. What is a pipeline?
A:
A pipeline combines preprocessing and model training into one flow to avoid data leakage.

-------------------------------------------------

Q26. What is data leakage?
A:
When test data information leaks into training, causing unrealistically high performance.

-------------------------------------------------

Q27. What is cross-validation?
A:
A technique where data is split into multiple folds to get stable performance.

-------------------------------------------------

Q28. What is KNN?
A:
KNN predicts based on the closest K neighbors.

-------------------------------------------------

Q29. What is the role of K?
A:
- Small K → overfitting
- Large K → underfitting

-------------------------------------------------

Q30. What is SVM?
A:
SVM finds the best decision boundary with maximum margin between classes.

-------------------------------------------------

Q31. What is a kernel in SVM?
A:
A kernel transforms data into higher dimensions to handle non-linear data.

-------------------------------------------------

Q32. What is a Decision Tree?
A:
A tree-based model that makes decisions using rules.

-------------------------------------------------

Q33. Why do trees overfit?
A:
Because deep trees memorize training data.

-------------------------------------------------

Q34. What is Random Forest?
A:
An ensemble of multiple decision trees that reduces overfitting.

-------------------------------------------------

Q35. What is Boosting?
A:
Boosting trains models sequentially, where each model learns from previous mistakes.

-------------------------------------------------

Q36. Difference between Random Forest and Boosting?
A:
Random Forest reduces variance.
Boosting reduces bias.

-------------------------------------------------

Q37. What is XGBoost?
A:
An optimized boosting algorithm with regularization and high performance.

-------------------------------------------------

Q38. What is model deployment?
A:
Making a trained model available for real-world use (API, app, etc.).

-------------------------------------------------

Q39. What is a .pkl file?
A:
A serialized file used to save trained models in Python.

-------------------------------------------------

Q40. What metrics do you use?
A:
Regression:
- MSE, RMSE, R²

Classification:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall

-------------------------------------------------

Q41. What is MLOps (basic)?
A:
MLOps is the practice of managing ML models in production (training, versioning, monitoring).

-------------------------------------------------

Q42. How do you explain your ML project?
A:
"I built an end-to-end ML pipeline including preprocessing, model training, tuning, evaluation, and model saving for deployment."
